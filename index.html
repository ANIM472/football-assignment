                <p>The Copa América is the world's oldest international football tournament. The event was first held in
                    1916 in honour of the 100th anniversary of Argentina's independence—with Uruguay winning the
                    inaugural title. It took place every one to four years before it adopted its current quadrennial
                    format in 2007.</p>
